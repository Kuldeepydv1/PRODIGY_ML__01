RODIGY INTERNSHIP - MACHINE LEARNING

I would like to express my gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects and for the invaluable support and guidance throughout my internship journey. Here is my approach on the tasks provided to me

TASK 1 : House Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

TASK 2 : Customer segmentation

This project aims to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Using K-means clustering, customers are grouped into clusters according to their purchase frequency and total amount spent. The dataset used for this analysis includes synthetic customer purchase history data, containing information such as how often customers make purchases and the total amount they spend. The K-means algorithm is applied to this data to identify distinct customer segments, allowing the retail store to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to different customer groups effectively. The project includes code for generating the synthetic dataset, performing K-means clustering, and visualizing the resulting clusters.

TASK 3 : Cat vs Dog

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify images of cats and dogs using the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) Cats vs Dogs dataset. The dataset consists of a large set of images of cats and dogs. The images are preprocessed, resized, and normalized before being fed into the SVM model. The SVM model is trained on a subset of the dataset and achieves a certain accuracy level. Finally, the trained model is tested on a sample image to demonstrate its classification capabilities. This project provides a simple yet effective example of using machine learning algorithms, specifically SVM, for image classification tasks.
